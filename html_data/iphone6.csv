Great price thats the main great thing. Nothing wrong with it. If your gonna get one get it from these guys

It was easy to set up and to transfer all my data from my Samsung S4.  It was a great choice and a great price!",4.6,"fast, apple, refurbished, shipping, scratches"

By far the worst phone I've ever purchased. It acts like  it is in habited by a poltergeist as the screen often times tweaks out and spontaneously opens up different apps and tabs and calls people and does not respond when I attempt to correct its mistakes.  I am now at the point to where I am fed up with this and I am afraid to use my phone because it will randomly call people and leave random text messages and make me look like an idiot to other people because it's freaking out and glitching. Other times the touch screen is not even responding/sensitive. Very disappointed.

the screen is kinda cracked on arrival.the on/off switch for vibration/silent goes on and off automatically.",2.1,"screen, charger, apple, scratches, refurbished"

Disaster, after 3 weeks using, never turn on again...not recomended, don't buy with this seller...I lost my $245!!!

Meet all expectations, works fine abroad. I'm using it in Ecuador, South America and works flawless. I give the seller five stars.",3.4,"apple, price, problems, iphone"

Tired of doing resetting stuff,  On my android phones, things were easier... but will muddle through with this.. POS. not the sellers fault that iphones are all POS.

I really like this phone! I got it to transfer my Tracfone number to a nice smartphone. It works great! The transfer was easy and I keep up with minutes through the Tracfone app. I love the fingerprint recognition instead of a password. Feel like I've finally joined the 21st century!

This phone is everything you need. Still gets the latest updates and has enough memory and speed for basic apps (i.e. browsing, social media, pictures, and music). Newer iPhones are faster, but what are we talking about..a couple seconds? Hardly a reason to go for broke. Think about it.",3.7,"new, iphone, product, brand, iphone"

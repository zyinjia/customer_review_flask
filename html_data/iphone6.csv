0,7884,"Love AmazonReviews should say for the people who don't know you have to get a SIM card for whatever provider you plan on getting Verizon, sprint strait talk etc.Also verify 100% the phone will work for whatever provider you want I bought it wanting to put it on Verizon and I couldnt.had no choice could only go strait talk

Wifi and Bluetooth doesn't works, also didn't recognize my SIM

The phone would not consistently recognize my Sim card.  It was basically in a perpetual state of searching for service.  I am, needless to say, very angry...!!!! Although it has one star I give it 0.",3.4,"sim, card, problem, months, issues"
1,524,"Still getting used to it... can't send MMS pictures by text.. got it set up to do it, but when I restarted the phone, I lost the settings... Tired of doing resetting stuff,  On my android phones, things were easier... but will muddle through with this.. POS. not the sellers fault that iphones are all POS.

This phone is everything you need. Still gets the latest updates and has enough memory and speed for basic apps (i.e. browsing, social media, pictures, and music). Newer iPhones are faster, but what are we talking about..a couple seconds? Hardly a reason to go for broke. Think about it.

Ordered for my son.  Arrived as promised and works and looks great!",3.9,"new, iphone, product, brand, iphone"
2,504,"very poorly scratched, the buttons are not working proper. hopefully retuning it and getting another one from different seller.

Meet all expectations, works fine abroad. I'm using it in Ecuador, South America and works flawless. I give the seller five stars.

Disaster, after 3 weeks using, never turn on again...not recomended, don't buy with this seller...I lost my $245!!!",3.4,"apple, price, problems, new, iphone"

By far the worst phone I've ever purchased. It acts like  it is in habited by a poltergeist as the screen often times tweaks out and spontaneously opens up different apps and tabs and calls people and does not respond when I attempt to correct its mistakes.  I am now at the point to where I am fed up with this and I am afraid to use my phone because it will randomly call people and leave random text messages and make me look like an idiot to other people because it's freaking out and glitching. Other times the touch screen is not even responding/sensitive. Very disappointed.

Just OK. The screen has a loose end. Buyer offered to send it back, but I'm abroad. So couldn't take the offer.",2.1,"screen, charger, apple, scratches, refurbished"
4,255,"I used it about 4 days . first of all it has a good and fresh phn but inside it has a bad battery life. it shows 20% battery and after 1 minutes its switch off. very disapointed with that. after five minutes i tried to restart it it restart again and it shows 24% charge :(

I got this as a replacement for a phone with a shot battery. Now this one has a shot battery too:/ completely ridiculous. And TWO DAYS before the 90 day warranty expires.

The battery, since I bought it, has failed. I sent an e-mail to claim for it but I haven't received any response yet.",2.2,"battery, time, screen, iphone"
5,195,"This is not A1586 model, even it has the A1586 price tag. Received A1549. If I want A1549, I can get it 200 bucks cheaper!

Great price thats the main great thing. Nothing wrong with it. If your gonna get one get it from these guys

It was easy to set up and to transfer all my data from my Samsung S4.  It was a great choice and a great price!",4.6,"fast, apple, refurbished, shipping, scratches"

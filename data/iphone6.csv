This buy satisfied my needs, it came in decent packaging, and as described showed little wear. A few small marks and dents in the metal outer casing exist, but the phone is scratch-free. The battery life seems fine, and the phone operates to full capacity with all the apps I've downloaded. The vibrate function is a little rattly, it doesn't sound perfect but this isn't a new phone. The hardest part about buying this refurbished phone, was the activation part with my carrier. Took several hours and changing of a few identification numbers with the phone, because those IDs had been previously used by another person. I am fairly confident I would buy again in this manner instead of buying new, as long as the quality of the product is the same as this one.",purchased refurbished iphone save bit opted not buy brand new iphone also skip iphone series seemed little pricey buy satisfied needs came decent packaging described showed little wear small marks dents metal outer casing exist phone scratch free battery life seems fine phone operates full capacity apps downloaded vibrate function little rattly sound perfect new phone hardest part buying refurbished phone activation part carrier took several hours changing identification numbers phone ids previously used another person fairly confident would buy manner instead buying new long quality product one

I bought it a few months ago and it worked wonderfully.  However I started noticing issues with the sound after about two months.  I could only use the speaker function to dial and to receive calls.  If I used earbuds, it seemed to work better.  However, yesterday when I put my earbuds in to listen to music, no sound came out at all.  When I tried to answer a phone cal, I put it on speaker and could barely understand anything my friend was saying.  She couldn't understand me either.I'm pretty disappointed with the quality of this phone and wish that these issues had occurred within a month so I could return this phone and get my money back.  Unfortunately it's too late now and I'm stuck with a phone that can't call or receive calls and can't even act as an iPod for music.  Pretty disappointing indeed.",happy find iphone good price since certified refurbished bought months ago worked wonderfully however started noticing issues sound two months could use speaker function dial receive calls used earbuds seemed work better however yesterday put earbuds listen music no sound came tried answer phone cal put speaker could barely understand anything friend saying understand either pretty disappointed quality phone wish issues occurred within month could return phone get money back unfortunately late stuck phone call receive calls even act ipod music pretty disappointing indeed

We didn't keep this phone bc it turned out to have been made for the Japanese market so we couldn't turn off the camera shutter sound. Additionally, the battery would sporadically die. However, when we contacted the seller about swapping it out for a phone that would be made for the US, he was amazingly responsive & 100% honest that they could not guarantee we would not get another phone with the same feature. I was impressed by how quickly the seller returned my emails and that they were honest about what they could provide. We had previously purchased a refurb phone for my daughter and have had no issues, but this is the 2nd refurb 5S we've gotten recently (the first was a Groupon deal that was also returned) and it's the 2nd one that ended up being made for the Japanese market and could not have the shutter sound muted. I ended up buying directly from a seller on Swappa so that I could be sure I would not have this same issue for a 3rd time. I would say that at this point, it's going to be hit or miss buying a 5S so as long as you know you can return it if there are any problems, it's worth the savings to give it a try.",nothing good things say seller phone disappointing keep phone bc turned made japanese market turn camera shutter sound additionally battery would sporadically die however contacted seller swapping phone would made us amazingly responsive honest could not guarantee would not get another phone feature impressed quickly seller returned emails honest could provide previously purchased refurb phone daughter no issues nd refurb gotten recently first groupon deal also returned nd one ended made japanese market could not shutter sound muted ended buying directly seller swappa could sure would not issue rd time would say point going hit miss buying long know return problems worth savings give try

It would go dead leaving me stranded with no phone and no way to contact people or use a map search to find your way around after I took it off a charger. I would have 90% battery, request an Uber and in 2 minutes it would be dead. I love taking pictures and there is no way to shut off the loud clicking shutter sound (even with volume at 0). Searching online people say the shutter sound being constant is because of the way my phone was unlocked. I can't say for sure why this happens but I'm pretty tech savvy and I've tried everything under the sun to make it stop to no avail. So when taking a picture in a quiet environment I would get ""the look"" from people after shattering the quiet with my phone. I have to fly home to see my family this week but I might have to travel without a phone b/c I have tech service  scheduled with the Apple Store for Monday or I might end up having to get a new phone.

I loved that I could set this phone prior to activating the phone on my UK SIM (because I had a random SIM hanging around), downloading the apps I needed and getting everything going. So far everything looks good.The minus star goes to the seller using a mailing label on the back of the phone telling the customer to call them for any problems. I get that but it took me no joke 20 minutes to get the sticker off and I scratched my phone a bit with my nails. Plus messed up my nail polish but I can get over that.

So for starters the phone came in EXCELLENT CONDITION, no dings or scratches. I was worried about that because of the mixed reviews but wow it look completely brand new. So the next step was going about installing the service to my phone. HERE ARE THE STEPS: 1.Go to a metro pcs store and tell them you want service on the phone... BAM YOU'RE DONE! It was just that easy, it cost 10 dollars for them to move the phone to metro and it cost 10 dollars for a sim card they have at store. The phone is working perfectly fine and fast, and this is my first time using an iPhone. I came over here from the Galaxy s5 and i loved that phone but once it started to break i decided it was time to finally give the iPhone a try. I am not disappointed what so ever.

175719,Apple,174.33,Apple iPhone 6 16GB Factory Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Internal Smartphone - Space Gray,5,10,"Perfect!  After reading several of the 1 or 2 star reviews, I was very hesitant to purchase this phone.  But I figured that it had a 90 day warranty, so if it showed up defective/scratched/broken/etc., I would just return it.  Phone arrived on time.  After initial inspection, there were no cracks/scratches/etc.  It looked like new.  I was then a bit worried about the functionality.  I've had it all weekend plus a few days, and have gone through most functions that I can thin of, and the only problem I encountered was that the speaker didn't work during one outgoing call (which happened a few times with other phones I've owned).  A restart of the phone and it worked fine (probably an issue with the multiple BT devices that I have connected to the phone).  The last thing I was worried about was the battery life.  If this phone had been used (and then refurbished), the battery life would not be what it was when new.  That was not an issue at all.  The battery life is phenomenal.  The phone was either never used for any length of time (e.g. opened, and then returned to the store for whatever reason, and then sent to a 3rd party refurbisher and then purchased by me), or, it was used very lightly, and then refurbished (which included putting a new battery in it).  Either way, I'm very happy.",perfect reading several star reviews hesitant purchase phone figured day warranty showed defective scratched broken etc would return phone arrived time initial inspection no cracks scratches etc looked like new bit worried functionality weekend plus days gone functions thin problem encountered speaker work one outgoing call happened times phones owned restart phone worked fine probably issue multiple bt devices connected phone last thing worried battery life phone used refurbished battery life would not new not issue battery life phenomenal phone either never used length time e g opened returned store whatever reason sent rd party refurbisher purchased used lightly refurbished included putting new battery either way happy

That said, I eventually realised the *product* reviews relate to a variety of Sellers, as when you select a certain combo of colour/size, the Seller changes. With that in mind, I was careful to review the Seller specifically (on their main site) - since BuySpry had very positive reviews I moved forward.The phone is in great condition physically - no scratches or wear and tear are visible. It arrived nicely packaged in a plastic case, with protective plastic on the screen/back as well. It also arrives with a card from the seller advising to call a certain number if there was any issues, as well as a ""Certified Refurbished by Amazon"" card which was comforting as Amazon backed the product. There was no issue setting up - my SIM fit and it was unlocked and works with Vodafone.I've only had it for less than a week, however, so far it works fine with very minimal issues. The battery is not the best (when at 10% it suddenly dies), however, it was to be expected with refurb. It lasts the majority of the day if you're not using a lot of apps (esp. FaceTime) which is similar to any iPhone after months of use.I live in Australia ordered the phone on a Monday evening (AEST) and it arrived by Thursday @ 4pm (AEST), although guarantee delivery wasn't till Friday.

Received it in a Amazon ""Certified Refurbished"" white box with the phone, a generic charger, and generic lightning cable. No earphones as stated by their description of purchase. All was great! No scratches, dings, or anything so it felt brand new. Set up was easy. Screen was great, sound was great, and battery life is superb. I came from using a Samsung Galaxy S4 with a replaceable battery, but even replacing them the batteries never last me a full 12 hours. I put this iPhone to the test by downloading and using the same apps I use for my Samsung. Mindblown. Unplugged the iPhone at 6:30AM with 100% charge, came back home at 10:00PM with 45% left, used it for a some more and slept at 12AM with 33% charge left. Wow. My samsung would've died at 9AM, recharge, and then die again at 3PM, and then recharge again at 7PM.MAJOR CON:Anyway, the main reason why I gave this only  a 4 star is because the version of iPhone I received is a Japanese iPhone. I CANNOT turn the  camera sound shutter off. Only phones in Japan have this. How do I know? I've lived there and all my friends' phones (including iphones) cannot have the camera shutter sound off even if silent due to Japanese regulation/law that passed back in the early 2000s. Apple and all cell phone companies must comply. I've been an iPhone user back in the day (3G/3GS/4S) and know how to silent this by (duh) putting the phone to silent mode. Nada. Googled a solution only to find out that I have to jailbreak it and remove/change a system UI file. Unfortunately, I don't want to do that and can't do that since I have the latest iOS version 10.3.2 (as of May 2017) so I'm stuck with an annoying camera shutter sound being always on.CONCLUSION:Other than the Major con, happy with the purchase!",major pro ordered iphone plus gb received amazon certified refurbished white box phone generic charger generic lightning cable no earphones stated description purchase great no scratches dings anything felt brand new set easy screen great sound great battery life superb came using samsung galaxy replaceable battery even replacing batteries never last full hours put iphone test downloading using apps use samsung mindblown unplugged iphone charge came back home pm left used slept charge left wow samsung would died recharge die pm recharge pm major con anyway main reason gave star version iphone received japanese iphone cannot turn camera sound shutter phones japan know lived friends phones including iphones cannot camera shutter sound even silent due japanese regulation law passed back early apple cell phone companies must comply iphone user back day g gs know silent duh putting phone silent mode nada googled solution find jailbreak remove change system ui file unfortunately want since latest ios version may stuck annoying camera shutter sound always conclusion major con happy purchase

Not a single scratch, ding or dent.But after using it for about two weeks, its OS started misbehaving in a weird manner with absolute bizarre activity on its own. Like it is possessed or something. Just after the opening screen, multiple haphazard screen activities commence as if an invisible finger is constantly pressing upon its screen. It types incorrect passwords on in its own. Initially I thought its operating system was corrupted so I updated its IOS to the latest version i.e., 10.2, but it behaved in the same manner. Absolutely pathetic. I removed its screen protector. Result the same.If Apple certifies such internal hardware, then you can expect Apple to become another big corporate IT fraud giant.

176048,Apple,344.99,Apple iPhone 6 16GB Factory Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Internal Smartphone - Space Gray,5,2,"Definitely my favorite iPhone so far! Apple hit a homer with this iPhone! First let me start off by saying this phone has the best battery I have ever had! Phones I've had: Samsung S6, iPhone 6, Nexus 6P, iPhone 5s, NONE of these can keep up with the battery on the iPhone 6 Plus. The camera is good although Samsung does make better cameras, you can always take a great picture with an iPhone. I recommend using google Photos app, there is a pop feature on there that makes your pictures look great. I also recommend the VSCO camera app for editing pictures.iOS runs fantastic on here and apps look beautiful on the larger display. I'd definitely recommend it over the regular 6. Althugh it is more expensive, once you get adjusted to the larger screen you definitely won't want to go back to a small screen. This is 2016, a 4.7 inch display on an iPhone is just too small. So if larger screen and better battery don't sell you, keep in mind the PLUS also has Optical Image Stabilization (OIS). This is an excellent feature which the iPhone 6 lacks and can be quite bothersome if you take pictures/videos of children or dogs because they tend to move and your pictures lose focus. I could not be happier with the iPhone 6 Plus.",definitely favorite iphone far apple hit homer iphone first let start saying phone best battery ever phones samsung iphone nexus p iphone none keep battery iphone plus camera good although samsung make better cameras always take great picture iphone recommend using google photos app pop feature makes pictures look great also recommend vsco camera app editing pictures ios runs fantastic apps look beautiful larger display definitely recommend regular althugh expensive get adjusted larger screen definitely want go back small screen inch display iphone small larger screen better battery sell keep mind plus also optical image stabilization ois excellent feature iphone lacks quite bothersome take pictures videos children dogs tend move pictures lose focus could not happier iphone plus

At first I thought it was my data, so I called straight talk to get it fixed, but my data is working fine and I have full range where I am, so it's not my data.  I really don't know why this is happening and if I'm the only one experiencing this.  But right now I don't know what I want to do about the phone because it is a perfectly great phone.

176672,Apple,344.99,Apple iPhone 6 16GB Factory Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Internal Smartphone - Space Gray,1,34,"I wanted to save some money now I'm wishing I just paid full price. This is the most I've ever spent for a phone and I've never had so many problems. I've had 3 issues with my refurbished iPhone 6plus and now I have to buy a new phone. I'm past the 90 day warranty, and Apple won't help because it is refurbished.I've done some research on iFixit, Reddit, YouTube, Yahoo  answers, etc.. I see these are all common problems with 3RD PARTY REFURBISHED iPhones. Seems like these guys cant put a phone together like they do back in FoxCon.After this HORRIBLE phone experience, I will never ever buy a refurbished product on Amazon again.1. When I bought the 128 6plus iPhone there was a problem with the charger cable connection. It took a few tries to get the phone to start charging. I said ok, I can live with that. Well it turns out I can't. It's extremely annoying and getting worse every day. Now o sit there for a few minutes trying to make a connection. I try my wife and kids cables to no avail. Theirs work perfectly , mine won't. Hard to use a phone you can't charge! Plus I can't keep the damned thing connected to my MacBook when I am syncing, updating, or transferring files. Had to get a new cable right away because the cheap flimsy cord they send you is useless.2: BIGGEST PROBLEM: "" ghost touches""  or ""phantom touches"" I started experiencing phantom touches all over my screen, apps opening and closing, random calls made, emails, texts, music playing, etc. only way to stop is to quickly lock phone. Restarting doesn't help since this is a hardware issue. Rendering phone COMPLETELY USELESS for hours on end! Comes and goes randomly at most inconvenient times.3: Then the complete opposite happens. I try to touch the screen and I don't get any response at all. Tap tap tap away- nada. This leaves me with the option to use Siri only, since the physical buttons are the only way to control the phone. Again, restarting does not help.Thanks for nothing Amazon, feels like I got ripped off on eBay or Craigslist!",wanted save money wishing paid full price ever spent phone never many problems issues refurbished iphone plus buy new phone past day warranty apple help refurbished done research ifixit reddit youtube yahoo answers etc see common problems rd party refurbished iphones seems like guys cant put phone together like back foxcon horrible phone experience never ever buy refurbished product amazon bought plus iphone problem charger cable connection took tries get phone start charging said ok live well turns extremely annoying getting worse every day sit minutes trying make connection try wife kids cables no avail work perfectly mine hard use phone charge plus keep damned thing connected macbook syncing updating transferring files get new cable right away cheap flimsy cord send useless biggest problem ghost touches phantom touches started experiencing phantom touches screen apps opening closing random calls made emails texts music playing etc way stop quickly lock phone restarting help since hardware issue rendering phone completely useless hours end comes goes randomly inconvenient times complete opposite happens try touch screen get response tap tap tap away nada leaves option use siri since physical buttons way control phone restarting not help thanks nothing amazon feels like got ripped ebay craigslist

176843,Apple,344.99,Apple iPhone 6 16GB Factory Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Internal Smartphone - Space Gray,5,63,"I've had this phone almost a week and have had absolutely nothing to complain about. Granted it's only been several days nonetheless the phone so far is great. I bought the 128gb space gray 6 plus Certified Refurbished. There were less gb choices that cost more which made me question the quality of the product.Will it overheat? Will the battery drain quickly? No and no. I've purposefully left my charger off to the side and used Netflix and Pandora (apps I figured would test the battery) and surprisingly there was, I think, a 38% charge the next day. The battery was my biggest concern and it is safe to say I am no longer concerned.How is the exterior? Even though I had already planned on buying a case that would cover the phone I wouldn't enjoy chips and scratches. The exterior is fantastic and really does look as good as new.As for operating the phone, is it slow? Are the any issues using any of the apps? So far it works like a charm. No, I have not used all the apps. But of what I have used it works just fine. I stream fine, make calls and text fine, etc.The camera works great and everything is very clear on this phone. Even though the phone has a 5.5 inch screen, Apple did a great job of achieving slimness. I have a very protective case over the phone and it is still slim.If any of you are wondering about carriers I have Metro PCS and there are no issues. The phone connects great to my service provider. The phone only came with a charger, no manual or headphones. There are no issues with the charger.A negative review I read about the phone (a 64gb one and this applies to all other gb choices) is that you do not get as much memory as advertised. This is false. The software on the phone and apps will take up space. I believe about 14gb was used on the phone before I started using it. The phone is still a 128gb one.The seller of my item is BuySPRY.",phone almost week absolutely nothing complain granted several days nonetheless phone far great bought gb space gray plus certified refurbished less gb choices cost made question quality product overheat battery drain quickly no no purposefully left charger side used netflix pandora apps figured would test battery surprisingly think charge next day battery biggest concern safe say no longer concerned exterior even though already planned buying case would cover phone enjoy chips scratches exterior fantastic really look good new operating phone slow issues using apps far works like charm no not used apps used works fine stream fine make calls text fine etc camera works great everything clear phone even though phone inch screen apple great job achieving slimness protective case phone still slim wondering carriers metro pcs no issues phone connects great service provider phone came charger no manual headphones no issues charger negative review read phone gb one applies gb choices not get much memory advertised false software phone apps take space believe gb used phone started using phone still gb one seller item buyspry

Since they're still really expensive we looked on amazon for a cheaper one. I had recently gotten a refurbished amazon Kindle Fire stick and it came in perfect condition, and I've heard good things about refurbished products so I decided to give this a shot. I had high hopes. It shipped the very next day and arrived only a few days later which was impressive. The phone looked brand new, no scratches, or any signs of use. It was simple and easy to switch my neices Virgin Mobile service over. She charged it fully overnight. The next day when it got to about 40% battery the phone shut off. She plugged it in and it came right back on. After a few days has gone by it doesnt always do it anymore, so we're hoping maybe it was just a glitch. We're gonna buy a battery case so if it happens again she can just turn on the battery case. I did think about returning it, and even contacted the seller. They responded like twelve hours later apologizing and telling me if Id like a refund to initiate it thru amazon. My neice decided to just keep it. She really loves it and is happy with it.**EDIT**11/4 -changed my review from 3 to 4 stars.My neice told me that the battery seems to be working better now. Not sure if its the battery exactly, just that it isnt shutting off at 40% all the time anymore. Shes had it a couple months now and really loves it!

177433,Apple,299.99,Apple iPhone 6 16GB Factory Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Internal Smartphone - Space Gray,2,9,"Well, I was very excited when I purchased this phone.  It looked good, too--a little scratch, but otherwise pretty decent.  Plus, 128 gig, finally I could save videos and aps and not have to worry about erasing something every couple of days.  So then I started using it to talk... major fail.  Even with the volume turned ALL THE WAY up, I could hardly hear the other person.  A lot of times I would call and I couldn't tell whether the phone was still ringing or the person had picked up.  To work around that I would put it on speaker, but then the other person could hardly hear me.  I started using earphones so that I could hear the phone and my callers could hear me (even when it was against my face).But then there were the battery issues... it would all of a sudden go from 7 % to dead, and then sometimes if I plugged it in it would jump up 20% immediately.  What?  What's that about?  Was it not reflecting the true charge or not holding the charge?  Once I was outside on a cooler day (maybe 50 degrees F) and the battery was at about 46%.  Suddenly it died.  Totally dead, from almost 50%... and I was expecting an important call.Then, similarly, a couple of days ago I had it at 60%.  I put it down, and when I picked it up again (about half an hour later) it was dead.  I mean DEAD.  No amount of plugging in could resuscitate it.  It was just gone.  Now I am a month and a half into using a ""new"" phone which is now dead.  I'm wondering whether it might be the battery, and whether it's worth replacing the battery which *might* be the (read: one) problem on an otherwise problematic phone, or to drop several hundred more dollars trying to replace it with another potentially faulty phone.  I enjoyed the extra storage, but in just about every other way I am not happy with this purchase.***Update: I spoke to Amazon about the purchase, and they came through for me once again!  Very pleased with Amazon customer service!

I just want the seller to know that there is a sane difference in refurbished and repaired. What I got was a phone with replaced/ repaired screen and even that screen was not an original iPhone screen. Just for all you guys out there, the way to identify whether the screen is repaired or original; (a) When you put some pressure on original screen, you won't see any fade of colors while you will see colors heavily fading from the pressured area on the screen. That's third party, low grade screen for iphones and are not of good quality at all. (b) You'll always find a thin gap on the sides of the screen and phone, accidental exposure to water from the sides can immediately damage the phone. However, when Apple replaces a screen, its replaced via machines so there is no gap at all.How can you sell something like that? Selling cheap without letting others know what it could be is simply fooling others and by the way it wasn't cheap enough to match what you actually sold.

It doesn't pick up on my home wifi when my old phone could and others can so it runs on my data most of the time and it is so slow.

I'll be on my phone for maybe an hour and it'll go down 20% or more. Also when I try to connect it to my computer it says iphone not found even when the phone recognizes that it is connected to the computer. What is the most recent thing is it no longer can fine service. I will be out during the day or even just sitting at home and my phone no longer has any service. It will say searching or no service so I looked up on apple how to fix this and nothing works. I just have to restart my phone about 10 times before it will pop up again.

177597,Apple,299.99,Apple iPhone 6 16GB Factory Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Internal Smartphone - Space Gray,5,4,"Apple did a great job with this phone.  I bought this to replace my girlfriend's Galaxy S5, and she couldn't be happier!  The phone arrived quickly (Prime same-day), I cut my girlfriend's micro-SIM down to a nano-SIM (carefully) and popped it in, added her Google account with all of her email and contacts, and she was up and running, all within about 15 minutes!I use an iPhone SE for work, and a Galaxy S6 Edge the rest of the time.  The iPhone 6 is only slightly smaller and lighter than my S6, but it feels much thinner, much lighter, and is so much more comfortable to hold.  The S6 has a larger screen, and WAY more pixels, but the screen on the iPhone 6 looks way better to me.  Just like my iPhone SE, the iPhone 6 lasts all day on a single charge (unless you're playing Pokemon Go), and when the battery finally runs down, it charges back up in no time.Switching between WiFi and 4G (like when leaving my house in the morning) is so much smoother than with my S6.  With the S6, if I'm outside, with poor WiFi signal, I have to turn WiFi off to force the 4G connection, where the iPhone is completely seamless.I switched from iOS to Android after Apple stopped innovating (iPhone 4, 4S, 5, ...), switched from Samsung when they did the same (Galaxy S3, S4, S5), then from HTC when they also followed suit (HTC One M7, M8, M9).  I've been super happy with my S6 Edge for the past year, but I like the iPhone 6 so much, it might be time to make a move back to Apple for my primary, and order one of these for myself!The only complaint I have is the short, cheap lightning cable Apple ships with their phones.  I ordered some of the 6 ft. Amazon Basics cables (Apple Certified), and I'm expecting them to last at least twice as long as the Apple cable.Other thoughts: 16 GB?!  That leaves less than 10 GB usable after the space required for the OS.  Geez Apple, memory is so cheap!

I had read all sorts of reviews about how people had been gypped out of their brand new phone, or they were missing items so I was a little skeptical after I'd ordered. But here I am, SIM card transferred and in my new phone that works just like it should. The EarPods work, I've yet to see if the charging equipment works because I already have some. Regardless, cosmetically, everything looks untouched and perfect. I'm so happy with my purchase, especially since I ordered it before the beginning of the year, before taxes were taken. 🤘🏼😅 Though it is nice to have money...it's even nicer to treat yourself with a phone you've wanted since its release. I ordered my iPhone 6 from Supreme Deals 18 and they DELIVERED. Thank you so much!!! I do recommend ordering from these people and may order again in the future.Edit: day two and my phone is having battery problems. I knew there had to be something wrong with it and it was too good to be true. So I'm sitting here playing Minecraft on my phone, it was at around 35%. It then warns I'm at 10%, so I click home and my phone is displaying 1%. Give. Me. A. Break. You've got a really bad battery and/or battery display. This is supposed to be brand new. Also I'm seeing on the edge of the phone near the corner of the display there are slivers of light shining through. That's not a huge problem, I'm just disappointed that my battery/battery display system or whatever isn't functioning.

I even took it to an Apple store to get the firmware replaced with a U.S. version and that didn't fix the problem either.  Also note that Apple will not replace your phone for you if you buy this phone; they will only give you a replacement if you bought a U.S. version. I have to return the phone now and I'm pretty pissed off.EDIT: I just got off the phone with Apple support. Apparently not only will they not replace the phone for you, they will NOT SERVICE THE PHONE whatsoever in the U.S. either. So if you bring this into the apple store within your 1 year manufacturer's warranty period because of some hardware or software issue, then you will NOT be able to get any assistance with the phone because it is a Japanese model.I am incredibly pissed off that none of this was disclosed to me when I purchased the phone.",first review writing pretty pissed purchase ignored lot star reviews bought turns right phone received japanese model everything works perfectly fine except shutter sound impossible disable even took apple store get firmware replaced u version fix problem either also note apple not replace phone buy phone give replacement bought u version return phone pretty pissed edit got phone apple support apparently not not replace phone not service phone whatsoever u either bring apple store within year manufacturer warranty period hardware software issue not able get assistance phone japanese model incredibly pissed none disclosed purchased phone

I have not charged it since, besides listening to music through USB in my car when driving, and it's been almost a week.The build of this phone is beautiful.

The Apple folks looked up the serial number and to my surprise, told me the phone was put in service almost 2 years ago and was out of warranty and sent me on my way with no help.  Sending back for full refund.  Buyer beware.

I am now at the point to where I am fed up with this and I am afraid to use my phone because it will randomly call people and leave random text messages and make me look like an idiot to other people because it's freaking out and glitching. Other times the touch screen is not even responding/sensitive.

I was apprehensive because a few of my friends told me it wouldn't work where i live in the Caribbean (Turks & Caicos). It's almost been a month since ordering it and it's fully functioning and works with our Lime Carrier. The only negative i would've had was that the packaging was a bit dirty and the phone looked as though it was possibly used as the display phone in the apple store and then put into packaging. The battery was practically dead so i charged it before wrapping it. A plus though - atleast to me-  was that the home button was very sturdy so it'll be durable for long use.,great bought surprise gift mother birthday apprehensive friends told work live caribbean turks caicos almost month since ordering fully functioning works lime carrier negative would packaging bit dirty phone looked though possibly used display phone apple store put packaging battery practically dead charged wrapping plus though atleast home button sturdy durable long use

179807,Apple,299.99,Apple iPhone 6 16GB Factory Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Internal Smartphone - Space Gray,5,16,"The whole time I’ve had the iPhone 6, I’ve been playing a game. I hand the phone to someone, and guess what phone they use based on their immediate reaction. iPhone users are always shocked by the sheer size of the 6; they all think it must be the 6 Plus. Android users, on the other hand, are unfazed. ""This looks just like my phone,"" they all say.They’re not wrong. The iPhone 6 is 5.44 inches tall and 2.64 inches wide, which slots it right in between last year’s Moto X (also a 4.7-inch phone) and the new HTC One. It’s almost exactly the same size as Samsung’s Galaxy S5, just a little thinner and a little lighter. And it shares more in common with the world’s many Android phones — and the original, curvy iPhone — than with the sharp, rectangular iPhone 5S.THE IPHONE 6 IS THE BIG IPHONE FOR EVERYONEThe iPhone 5S was a stark piece of jewelry, a gorgeous object that was slightly cold and unapproachable. The iPhone 6 is far friendlier and far more usable. Mixing form and function this way is hard to do, and Apple gets it largely right.It’s simply and cleanly designed, with a metal back that curves cleanly around the sides. There are few seams and no ugly clutter. The only real flaw is the antenna design: Apple opted to essentially outline the top and bottom of the phone’s back with small plastic stripes where wireless radios can transmit signal. It just looks bad, like someone drew on my phone with a marker. HTC’s simple, striped design on the One M8 is far better, and even Apple’s glass-strip-on-the-top-and-bottom approach for the 5S looked nicer.In a weird way, slim and gorgeous as it is, this iPhone begs to have a case on it. (Apple makes some, including a really nice line of leather cases, and the third-party ecosystem is going to get even bigger.) It helps obscure the unsightly plastic strips, it makes the otherwise slick phone a little easier to grip, and it compensates for the awkwardly protruding camera lens on the back, which prevents the phone from sitting flat on a table. I’m worried I’m going to scratch the lens, and I’m annoyed that the phone wobbles. A case solves both problems.The 6 is big, much bigger than the 5S or the other iPhones that came before it. It’s even bigger than some other 4.7-inch phones; because Apple refuses to change the top and bottom bezels so as not to disturb the big home button, the phone is much taller than it needs to be. But it’s still usable in one hand and comfortable enough that I never feel terribly awkward using it. I have found myself holding it slightly differently, though: I tend to rest it on my fingers rather than grip it in my palm, the better to reach the farthest corners of the screen.",whole time iphone playing game hand phone someone guess phone use based immediate reaction iphone users always shocked sheer size think must plus android users hand unfazed looks like phone say not wrong iphone inches tall inches wide slots right last year moto x also inch phone new htc one almost exactly size samsung galaxy little thinner little lighter shares common world many android phones original curvy iphone sharp rectangular iphone iphone big iphone everyonethe iphone stark piece jewelry gorgeous object slightly cold unapproachable iphone far friendlier far usable mixing form function way hard apple gets largely right simply cleanly designed metal back curves cleanly around sides seams no ugly clutter real flaw antenna design apple opted essentially outline top bottom phone back small plastic stripes wireless radios transmit signal looks bad like someone drew phone marker htc simple striped design one far better even apple glass strip top bottom approach looked nicer weird way slim gorgeous iphone begs case apple makes including really nice line leather cases third party ecosystem going get even bigger helps obscure unsightly plastic strips makes otherwise slick phone little easier grip compensates awkwardly protruding camera lens back prevents phone sitting flat table worried going scratch lens annoyed phone wobbles case solves problems big much bigger iphones came even bigger inch phones apple refuses change top bottom bezels not disturb big home button phone much taller needs still usable one hand comfortable enough never feel terribly awkward using found holding slightly differently though tend rest fingers rather grip palm better reach farthest corners screen

Also, the silent button doesn't quite hold on the silent option (It sticks slightly), but I think it is due to dirt being within the button. I'm going to lightly clean it and see how it works in the next few days.Update: I've been using this phone for a few days now, and the GPS doesn't work completely, it's a few 100ft off.",received iphone promptly screen seems perfect phone little scratches body refurbished surprised seeing amount dirt around camera microphone speaker holes seem cleaned also silent button quite hold silent option sticks slightly think due dirt within button going lightly clean see works next days update using phone days gps work completely ft

950187,Apple,299.99,Apple iPhone 6 16GB Factory Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Internal Smartphone - Space Gray,3,14,"I got this one through TechnoMaster. Good seller this`s my 2nd iPhone Unlocked through this guys. This is iPhone 6 Model A1549, works with DIGITEL in Venezuela also LTE is properly working. I also try a Telefonica SIM in Mexico, and AT&T Sim in the US with no issues at all. Truly an unlocked one. Box come in original sealed package.Why I choose 3 stars? Well, I`ve been an iPhone user since 1st gen iPhone, iPhone3, iPhone4, iPhone 4S, iPhone 5, iPhone 5S and meanwhile this iPhone 6... I`ll always felt better with every new iPhone until this one. I believe iPhone 5S is equal or a little faster than this iPhone 6, also the user experience with phone proportions is better in iPhone 5S. Is really annoying need to use the ""smart small screen"" function (press home button in a tricky way) because the screen is so big that you need to use both hands for some functions. Yes the bigger screen is great when you have the time to browse the web, read your emails and so on, also to people with vision issues (the bigger letters are simple better), BUT for me, I use this iPhone mainly LIKE A PHONE, and it is just better the iPhone 5S size for FULL and faster functionality with only one hand.Also, I`m really MAD with iOs bugs, for example, if you use the ""Vibrate/Sound"" Button several times a day (I use it A LOT), well the iPhone just won`t sound at all, if you use Music it just muted, no matter how many times you press play/puse, stop, close all apps, turn switch to vibrate-sound  100times... if anoyone sent you a video through whatsapp it won`t sound, surfing the web: no sound, and so on... only fix: TURN OFF/ON your iphone... really??Another anyoning bug: Assistive touch function, I told you guys before that the screen is too big to use with only one hand, allright, iOs has this pretty cool function that shows a virtual HOME BUTTON into ur screen (I used it a lot in my last iPhone 5S), well you put this litte cool button in the middle left or right of the screen (to have it near of ur finger, right?) well, iOs just troll you and move it into the farest corner just to avoid you little finger to use it and have to use again: BOTH HANDS, ok you got me, where`s the hidden camera guys?...Another bug? iCloud control panel for windows sucks, iCloud photos stop sync (with PC or mac) when it wants, just simply dont work.Another one? Sometimes is just slow... with 5-10 apps openend or no one, iOs animation slows the use experience, even if you DISABLE animation in advance options...I`ve been using this iPhone6 for almost two months, and I`m not totally happy with it, its the more expensive phone I ever own, I wish I had for almost 1.000 bucks: the same coolest screen size, FASTER phone with a BRILLIANT iOS like it was in golden Apple years... this one its not the better I have owned.",got one technomaster good seller nd iphone unlocked guys iphone model works digitel venezuela also lte properly working also try telefonica sim mexico sim us no issues truly unlocked one box come original sealed package choose stars well iphone user since st gen iphone iphone iphone iphone iphone iphone meanwhile iphone always felt better every new iphone one believe iphone equal little faster iphone also user experience phone proportions better iphone really annoying need use smart small screen function press home button tricky way screen big need use hands functions yes bigger screen great time browse web read emails also people vision issues bigger letters simple better use iphone mainly like phone better iphone size full faster functionality one hand also really mad ios bugs example use vibrate sound button several times day use lot well iphone sound use music muted no matter many times press play puse stop close apps turn switch vibrate sound times anoyone sent video whatsapp sound surfing web no sound fix turn iphone really another anyoning bug assistive touch function told guys screen big use one hand allright ios pretty cool function shows virtual home button ur screen used lot last iphone well put litte cool button middle left right screen near ur finger right well ios troll move farest corner avoid little finger use use hands ok got hidden camera guys another bug icloud control panel windows sucks icloud photos stop sync pc mac wants simply dont work another one sometimes slow apps openend no one ios animation slows use experience even disable animation advance options using iphone almost two months not totally happy expensive phone ever wish almost bucks coolest screen size faster phone brilliant ios like golden apple years one not better owned

Packaging was professional looking and the phone looked brand new. It charged up wonderfully and the battery is fantastic so far. It came with a 90 day warranty through Amazon and he seller which is awesome as well. So glad I took another chance and bought from this seller. I highly recommend them if you do decide to buy this refurb.

When I opened the box a generic cord and cube were available as described. The phone looked amazing, no scratches dents, or dust. No signs of wear at all. The phone arrived complelty dead. Took an entire 12 hours on a genuine apple cord, which I own, until it finally turned on. Set up was easy and wifi worked great. The battery seemed to be lacking from the beginning.

After two weeks it finally could no longer be unplugged if you wanted to receive calls or texts because it would go from 100% charge to off. I tried resetting the phone, complelty erasing everything, nothing worked. At the end of the return period I finally was able to get it back from my mom so we could send it.

1055984,Apple,288.0,Apple iPhone 6 16GB Factory Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Internal Smartphone - Space Gray,1,12,"DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER. The phone isn't ""refurbished""- it's broken and unusable.Update: a few months later, and there are even more problems with this phone. Applications crash. It sends me reminders for things I completed weeks ago, and it sends a new reminder EVERY twenty minutes. This phone is barely useable. It sucks. I so wish I hadn't bought it. And the seller never responded to me about any of these issuesOld review: I like the look and feel of the phone, but it has *many* issues. I was upgrading from a 5s and the 6 seems like a great pick, but this seller clearly is just turning over broken phones and not doing the whole ""refurbishing"" part...The first issue is that applications keep crashing while I’m using it. This isn’t constant, but it’s happened multiple times, with various games/browsers, so I don’t like that.Another thing that’s even more annoying is that the volume doesn’t switch off. It pops back up to full volume immediately, or on its own randomly. Even when it IS in the mute position, the phone makes noise when getting texts, or taking a photo. I stopped by the Apple store to make sure I wasn’t confused and the Genius Bar woman was concerned and confused as well. She said if the volume is switched to off, the camera shutter should *not* make noise, yet it does. This is a nightmare at work when getting emails and texts. It's very loud and annoying, and this is embarrassing. It doesn’t stay in the mute position, it constantly slides back up. But even while it’s still in the mute position, it doesn’t mute the sounds.There is a new problem as of today, which is that it keeps saying my sent texts are undelivered, with the red exclamation, but then people respond to them. So I never know if something went through or not.The final thing that’s been “off” is that the screen sometimes gets wavy, which I’ve never experienced before in a phone. The first time this happened I was taking a photo through a window, so I didn’t think about it much and just assumed it was something to do with the glass. But it’s happened a few times now, while I’m texting, or on Facebook. I don’t even know why it would do thisI was expecting a used but perfect condition phone. This one clearly has some issues, and it’s not functioning as promised.",not buy seller phone refurbished broken unusable update months later even problems phone applications crash sends reminders things completed weeks ago sends new reminder every twenty minutes phone barely useable sucks wish bought seller never responded issuesold review like look feel phone many issues upgrading seems like great pick seller clearly turning broken phones not whole refurbishing part first issue applications keep crashing using constant happened multiple times various games browsers like another thing even annoying volume switch pops back full volume immediately randomly even mute position phone makes noise getting texts taking photo stopped apple store make sure confused genius bar woman concerned confused well said volume switched camera shutter not make noise yet nightmare work getting emails texts loud annoying embarrassing stay mute position constantly slides back even still mute position mute sounds new problem today keeps saying sent texts undelivered red exclamation people respond never know something went not final thing screen sometimes gets wavy never experienced phone first time happened taking photo window think much assumed something glass happened times texting facebook even know would thisi expecting used perfect condition phone one clearly issues not functioning promised

And I got unlucky.The seller, Vius, shipped the phone promptly, and at first glance, it looked good. Then I realized:- it had a number of dents and scratches, including one big one I could see from an arm's length. That alone violated what Amazon's ""Certified Refurbished"" guaranteed (""no visible cosmetic imperfections when held 12 inches away""). I don't know how Vius missed this.- the sockets (charging port, SIM card slot, earphone jack, even the speaker holes) had a lot of dirt in them. I found out when I couldn't properly fit the charging plug in. I've owned an iPhone 5 for almost four years, and I've never gotten my ports this clogged up...Well, I'm not too picky about that, actually. So I cleaned out all the ports and got down to checking the phone. My carrier could be detected (3G, calls, and SMS), memory indeed was 128Gb, camera and audio were working, and the display was great.Then I realized the battery was draining extremely quickly despite an initial 6-hour charge. After fully charging it twice more, I couldn't get it to last more than 6 hours. It would reach around 50% and then suddenly die. When opening the Settings > Battery portion, there was a notice that I needed to have the battery serviced.Granted, other sellers might give a better phone than what I got, so check the actual seller out before buying. I rated Vius with two stars because at least they delivered what I ordered on time and not some empty box. But in terms of the actual product, its good-as-dead battery makes it useless to me despite everything else working. What a shame.",seeing star reviews star reviews decided gamble got unlucky seller vius shipped phone promptly first glance looked good realized number dents scratches including one big one could see arm length alone violated amazon certified refurbished guaranteed no visible cosmetic imperfections held inches away know vius missed sockets charging port sim card slot earphone jack even speaker holes lot dirt found properly fit charging plug owned iphone almost four years never gotten ports clogged well not picky actually cleaned ports got checking phone carrier could detected g calls sms memory indeed gb camera audio working display great realized battery draining extremely quickly despite initial hour charge fully charging twice get last hours would reach around suddenly die opening settings battery portion notice needed battery serviced granted sellers might give better phone got check actual seller buying rated vius two stars least delivered ordered time not empty box terms actual product good dead battery makes useless despite everything else working shame

I took off the protective glass screen cover I've had on it since the beginning to see if that was the problem, but no.  It also, every time I unlock it, asks ""Do you want to enable automatic downloads on this device"" which I don't particularly, but since it didn't give me options other than ""yes"" or ""cancel"" and hitting cancel just meant I would gt the same notification again next time I unlocked the phone, I figured I might as well, if only to stop the notification.  but it won't let me enable automatic downloads.  When I move the slider to yes, it stays there for half a second and then slides back to no.  Very frustrating.

The phone also often shuts down on its own when the battery is 20%. Moreover, the phone is slow which makes the user experience terrible. Applications hang and touch sometimes doesn't work on screen. Fingerprint unlock is also slow.This is no where near an apple phone.

Simple, and helpful right? It would be if the company actually picked up the call or emailed you back. What a joke.I found out there are a couple work around a to these issues and I wasn't happy doing them, but I didn't want to be without a phone even for a couple days, (why I paid for this one to be over nighted to my dorm room, even though it ended up not able to be in my hands until two days after I was supposed to.) so I was going to keep it.Then it died at 40 some percent battery and now I'm going to just return it and never deal with magic mobile partners again.

I was a little leery of buying a ""secondhand"" phone, but I have been an Amazon customer for many years, and have always had a great experience. The few times I've ever had a problem with anything I've purchased, (very few times in many years), Amazon has taken great care to correct any issues in a very expedient manner, so I have come to really trust them. I am a Prime Member, I use the Prime Pantry Feature, I buy things off the regular site, etc. So I was more than willing to give the ""Certified Refurbished Phone Program"" a chance. However, I still read EVERY single review from other people who had bought a phone this way. And although there were some less-than-completely-positive reviews, there were far more happy and satisfied customer, than not. So I bought my iPhone 6 (not S) and it arrived 4 days earlier than expected, it looks BRAND NEW, and it is in perfect working order!! I could not be more happy with my phone. I also had great faith that if  wasn't happy, Amazon would make it right. But fortunately, it is everything I was hoping it would be, and more! I was expecting to see some scratches on the glass, and the body, which I was already willing to live with, since the price was so good, plus free Prime shipping. But this phone arrived looking absolutely brand new, with a charger that has a nice long cable. I already had a case for it, and headphones, so I didn't need to buy any other accessories.

1057489,Apple,174.33,Apple iPhone 6 16GB Factory Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Internal Smartphone - Space Gray,4,49,"I purchased a certified refurbished 32GB iPhone 5S (Silver) for a family member. I was pleasantly surprised by the excellent condition of phone, it was cosmetically flawless. Also the phone was very professionally packaged for shipment, and included a USB charger and Lightning cable (these were 3rd-party non-Apple accessories, but they worked fine). We transferred the SIM card over from an older phone that was being retired, and the phone activated on the carrier network (AT&T in this case) with no problem. The only issue I ran into was that after a week or two of use, it became clear that the battery in the phone was worn/defective; the phone had trouble holding a charge for a full day, and would sometimes die when the battery percentage still showed 20-30%. So I ended up returning the unit for a full refund under the 30-day return policy, and ordering a second unit. The second phone was in similarly excellent condition, and the battery is working as expected.Overall I would say that going with a certified refurbished iPhone is a great value, you can get a phone that is just a couple years old, but is in excellent condition, and costs roughly 1/3 or less of the original price. I think a key is to take advantage of the Amazon 30-day return policy, which most of the third-party sellers here seem to honor (make sure you confirm this before you order). Inspect the phone carefully when you receive it, and make sure you test the battery thoroughly over a couple days to make sure it is in good condition. If either is not satisfactory, return it for a full refund within 30 days (which includes free return shipping), and simply order another unit.",purchased certified refurbished gb iphone silver family member pleasantly surprised excellent condition phone cosmetically flawless also phone professionally packaged shipment included usb charger lightning cable rd party non apple accessories worked fine transferred sim card older phone retired phone activated carrier network case no problem issue ran week two use became clear battery phone worn defective phone trouble holding charge full day would sometimes die battery percentage still showed ended returning unit full refund day return policy ordering second unit second phone similarly excellent condition battery working expected overall would say going certified refurbished iphone great value get phone couple years old excellent condition costs roughly less original price think key take advantage amazon day return policy third party sellers seem honor make sure confirm order inspect phone carefully receive make sure test battery thoroughly couple days make sure good condition either not satisfactory return full refund within days includes free return shipping simply order another unit

1057520,Apple,174.33,Apple iPhone 6 16GB Factory Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Internal Smartphone - Space Gray,2,21,"I purchased this refurbished phone on Amazon and began using it in March of 2016. It's now October 2016 and it's virtually useless. Two things were immediately wrong with the phone. First, the back was significantly scratched up and did not appear new as promised. It was just cosmetic and I was going to use a case, so I didn't freak out. It is, after all, a refurbished phone. Also, since receiving the phone I have never been able to use it while it's plugged in. I didn't discover this until I already had it outside of the US, so I decided it wasn't worth the effort of getting it back to the US to exchange it. Now it makes me wonder if that was the first sign of the problems that I am now having. About a week ago the phone started randomly turning off and saying that it had a low battery in the middle of the day (it had previously lasted all day, easily). I would plug it in and when it turned back on it would say it was 40% charged still. This has gotten progressively worse each day until yesterday it began turning off after less than an hour while being 100% charged. I have tried restoring it along with various other suggestions on the internet, but it's not a software problem. When I removed the OtterBox that I'd been using I discovered that the screen is coming off, leading me to conclude that the battery is swelling (which would cause both the screen to detach and the phone to act as previously described). I have talked to the Authorized Apple repair technicians here in the country where I live, but they won't touch it if it's believed to be a swollen battery. They say that opening it will likely mean they couldn't close it again, it could cause someone harm, and that replacing the battery here costs 80% of the cost of a new phone anyway. Because it's refurbished and beyond the 90 days of guarantee, I have no recourse with Apple or the seller here. So, after only 7 months, I have a very expensive paperweight. Proceed with caution.",purchased refurbished phone amazon began using march october virtually useless two things immediately wrong phone first back significantly scratched not appear new promised cosmetic going use case freak refurbished phone also since receiving phone never able use plugged discover already outside us decided worth effort getting back us exchange makes wonder first sign problems week ago phone started randomly turning saying low battery middle day previously lasted day easily would plug turned back would say charged still gotten progressively worse day yesterday began turning less hour charged tried restoring along various suggestions internet not software problem removed otterbox using discovered screen coming leading conclude battery swelling would cause screen detach phone act previously described talked authorized apple repair technicians country live touch believed swollen battery say opening likely mean close could cause someone harm replacing battery costs cost new phone anyway refurbished beyond days guarantee no recourse apple seller months expensive paperweight proceed caution

I only cared if it worked and was cheap enough so that I would not regret loosing it or breaking again. I firmly believe that once you go to apple you never go back, so there was no question about the brand of the phone I was going to get. I really like how user friendly apple is and how well acquainted I am to it, just makes things easier. So I started looking for a cheap option on amazon. Another thing I really cared about was that the iPhone should have been unlocked, coz I was not planning on buying a sim card of any kind, but rather using my phone with wifi. Having these things in mind I knew that I most probably will not find the best possible option, it is almost impossible to find completely unlocked phones. Whatsoever, I ordered this one after having asked if it is unlocked to not and receiving a positive response. In short, the phone was not unlocked, but thankfully it only took few minutes to unlock it with my friend's sim card. There were no scratches on the phone (almost none). Works pretty well and I have been using it for over half year. So far no complaints, will update if I find any.Overall I am greatly satisfied with the phone though it doesn't perfectly fit the description.Update: I took the phone to the at&t for the purpose of buying a sim card. The girl who was trying to insert the card, couldn't close it afterwards and she broke that spot(meaning it is not broken, but doesn't fully close/go in). She took no responsibility whatsoever at all on her part, which was pretty annoying, but later on I took it to the apple store. they told me that this happened most probably (but not certainly) because it was a refurbished phone and that it will cost me about 40$ to get it fixed.

1057798,Apple,174.33,Apple iPhone 6 16GB Factory Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Internal Smartphone - Space Gray,5,2,"After loosing my phone again I needed a relatively cheap option and I didn't really care if it is used or not or how old or new it would be. I only cared if it worked and was cheap enough so that I would not regret loosing it or breaking again. I firmly believe that once you go to apple you never go back, so there was no question about the brand of the phone I was going to get. I really like how user friendly apple is and how well acquainted I am to it, just makes things easier. So I started looking for a cheap option on amazon. Another thing I really cared about was that the iPhone should have been unlocked, coz I was not planning on buying a sim card of any kind, but rather using my phone with wifi. Having these things in mind I knew that I most probably will not find the best possible option, it is almost impossible to find completely unlocked phones. Whatsoever, I ordered this one after having asked if it is unlocked to not and receiving a positive response. In short, the phone was not unlocked, but thankfully it only took few minutes to unlock it with my friend's sim card. There were no scratches on the phone (almost none). Works pretty well and I have been using it for over half year. So far no complaints, will update if I find any.Overall I am greatly satisfied with the phone though it doesn't perfectly fit the description.Update: I took the phone to the at&t for the purpose of buying a sim card. The girl who was trying to insert the card, couldn't close it afterwards and she broke that spot(meaning it is not broken, but doesn't fully close/go in). She took no responsibility whatsoever at all on her part, which was pretty annoying, but later on I took it to the apple store. they told me that this happened most probably (but not certainly) because it was a refurbished phone and that it will cost me about 40$ to get it fixed. But since I changed my mind about buying a sim card I did not go for fixing it.",loosing phone needed relatively cheap option really care used not old new would cared worked cheap enough would not regret loosing breaking firmly believe go apple never go back no question brand phone going get really like user friendly apple well acquainted makes things easier started looking cheap option amazon another thing really cared iphone unlocked coz not planning buying sim card kind rather using phone wifi things mind knew probably not find best possible option almost impossible find completely unlocked phones whatsoever ordered one asked unlocked not receiving positive response short phone not unlocked thankfully took minutes unlock friend sim card no scratches phone almost none works pretty well using half year far no complaints update find overall greatly satisfied phone though perfectly fit description update took phone purpose buying sim card girl trying insert card close afterwards broke spot meaning not broken fully close go took no responsibility whatsoever part pretty annoying later took apple store told happened probably not certainly refurbished phone cost get fixed since changed mind buying sim card not go fixing

Its OK but extremely short, probably 2 ft long.At this point I believe I purchased just a phone, accessories need to be purchased separately, since the ones that came with it are useless.

1058177,Apple,174.33,Apple iPhone 6 16GB Factory Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Internal Smartphone - Space Gray,5,1,"So far, so good. My wife's 5 year old Iphone 5 accidentally dropped into water, and stopped working immediately. She has become extremely dependent on her phone, so losing it caused great pain and suffering and required a replacement right away.As everyone knows, the carriers no longer offer free or discounted replacement phones every two years like they used to. We have AT&T Wireless service and didn’t want to be locked into another two year contract with an expensive payment plan, so we took a chance with a refurbished Iphone 5S from Amazon. It arrived sooner than promised. It came in a generic white box, with a charger plug and cable, but did not include headphones, a manual, or a SIM card. The phone appeared to be in like-new condition – no dents, scratches, etc.I went on Google and searched for a way to remove the sim card from her old phone and inset it into the new phone, and found a video on YouTube. It was pretty easy. The new phone was discharged and needed to be charged, so I did this.Once it charged for a while and had some life, I connected the phone to our WIFI network, turned it on, and followed the instructions. It loaded the new IOS 10 software. Keep in mind there’s no manual, so that’s about all the instructions provided cover.It’s a little confusing how to set the Iphone up. It was difficult navigating the AT&T & Apple site, so I wasn’t sure what data was already on the sim card, and was concerned I would wipe everything out if I chose the wrong option (i.e. restore Iphone, or set up new Iphone). “Restore Iphone” gave a scary warning, so I chose “set up new Iphone” and it seemed to work.Prior to being dunked in water, my wife had irregularly backed up the contacts and apps from her old phone onto our home computer via Itunes and the Icloud, but apparently her photos & notes didn’t get backed up, so unfortunately that data was lost. Luckily I had manually backed up her photos on our computer a few months ago, so luckily not everything was lost.She's only had the phone a few days, but the battery life seems good. Overall, the refurbished Iphone 5S that we purchased from Amazon seems like a good choice.",far good wife year old iphone accidentally dropped water stopped working immediately become extremely dependent phone losing caused great pain suffering required replacement right away everyone knows carriers no longer offer free discounted replacement phones every two years like used wireless service want locked another two year contract expensive payment plan took chance refurbished iphone amazon arrived sooner promised came generic white box charger plug cable not include headphones manual sim card phone appeared like new condition no dents scratches etc went google searched way remove sim card old phone inset new phone found video youtube pretty easy new phone discharged needed charged charged life connected phone wifi network turned followed instructions loaded new ios software keep mind no manual instructions provided cover little confusing set iphone difficult navigating apple site sure data already sim card concerned would wipe everything chose wrong option e restore iphone set new iphone restore iphone gave scary warning chose set new iphone seemed work prior dunked water wife irregularly backed contacts apps old phone onto home computer via itunes icloud apparently photos notes get backed unfortunately data lost luckily manually backed photos computer months ago luckily not everything lost phone days battery life seems good overall refurbished iphone purchased amazon seems like good choice

I did some research and found out that the reason for this is that the phone originated in Japan where there is a law requiring phones to have an audible camera sound. The information about the phone never stated that the phone could be from another country, and thus have different settings than the American counterparts. Another issue was that the phone screen had a crack in it the day after I had received this phone. I had not really used it yet because I need to get it set up still, and yet there the crack was. I contacted the seller, stating the problem and that the phone shouldn't have a problem after not being used. I was told by the seller that though there is a 90-day warranty on the phone, the warranty does not cover physical damage. Overall, I feel that this product was incredibly misrepresented to me, and it will not be somewhere I will look for a phone in the future.",purchased phone noticed something odd camera sound could not silenced way research found reason phone originated japan law requiring phones audible camera sound information phone never stated phone could another country thus different settings american counterparts another issue phone screen crack day received phone not really used yet need get set still yet crack contacted seller stating problem phone problem not used told seller though day warranty phone warranty not cover physical damage overall feel product incredibly misrepresented not somewhere look phone future

1059689,Apple,174.33,Apple iPhone 6 16GB Factory Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Internal Smartphone - Space Gray,1,0,This review is a reflection of the sellers quality of item. I like iphone just fine. This iPhone however started having battery issues just a few months after purchase. At times the battery will completely shut down the phone at a percent anything less than 50%. Other times it will last on 1% battery for quite a while...30 minutes or longer. The other issue with this particular phone is that the camera cannot be silenced. I've done my homework and it seems the issue is likely that it's an imported model(countries like Japan have laws in place that cameras cannot be silenced). Would certainly not buy from this seller again.,review reflection sellers quality item like iphone fine iphone however started battery issues months purchase times battery completely shut phone percent anything less times last battery quite minutes longer issue particular phone camera cannot silenced done homework seems issue likely imported model countries like japan laws place cameras cannot silenced would certainly not buy seller

My old iphone was having no service issues randomly dropping. This seems to be working, will update if it fails. Slight dent in one corner of the phone otherwise it looks pretty much new. Way better than buying from the retailer where they only sell the newest and best phones for half a grand. I went with this instead of Gazelle because this has a 90 day warranty on it I think Gazelle only has 30. Plus Gazelle makes you pay more for ""fair, good or excellent"" quality. I think this one you just pay one price and get a decent phone. Could be a crap shoot though but I would say mine is somewhere between good and excellent condition. I would use this again instead of buying a new phone for 3x the price.",far good always skeptical making big purchase old iphone no service issues randomly dropping seems working update fails slight dent one corner phone otherwise looks pretty much new way better buying retailer sell newest best phones half grand went instead gazelle day warranty think gazelle plus gazelle makes pay fair good excellent quality think one pay one price get decent phone could crap shoot though would say mine somewhere good excellent condition would use instead buying new phone x price
